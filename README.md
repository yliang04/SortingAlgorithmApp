# Sorting Algorithm App

#### Introduction
This is an Angular application that animates the process of sorting an array
of numbers using various sorting algorithms. Here is a list of currently
implemented algorithms
* Bubble Sort
* Heap Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Radix Sort

I uses the Strategy pattern to implement different algorithems. It should make it
easy to add new ones in the future.

#### Video Demo

You can watch a demo of this application at this Youtube 
[link](https://youtu.be/6Opfnugm150). Please note that more than half of the video 
was just waiting on bubble sort which took a long time to run. I had to cut it 
short at the end.
